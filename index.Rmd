# Global Forest as a Complex systems

--


## Complex systems: emergent behavior
--

### Could not be explained by the behavior of their components

--

### Global forest: these methods can be applied to forests at any place on the earth

???

* I think about forest as a complex system and I talk about global forest
* Because these methods to determine critical can be applied to any place on earth
* Whicht is the main characteristic of complex systems?
* It is emergent behavior 
* the system could react in ways that are not easily predicted by the behavior of the components

## Critical transitions

--
### Sudden change of the state of the system

--
### Very large areas provides a better scale to detect critical transitions 

--
### we started with a simple model with two states


???

One of these emergent phenomena are critical transitions 
which produces a sudden change of the state of the system
is important to mention that ...

???
In this simple forest model we have forest and non-forest or empty sites

The state of the system changes with a control parameterr the growth rate called lambda

We have two possible state changes for the system, forest survival, forest extinction
and a third state that is fragmented forest.

So we start from lambda 3 to 2.5, we are simulating that the forest can grow less, 
then from 2.5 to 2.0, the unexpected change is from 2.0 to 1.5 because the system
collapses and the forest go extinct.

## Largest patch fluctuations 

<img src="Figures/DeltaSmax3.5-1.5.gif" width="80%">

???
One way to detect the fragmentation transitions is to watch the fluctuations 
of the largest patch, if the fluctuations are small we are far from the critical transitions
if the fluctuations are large we are probabily near a critical point

## Early warnings of fragmentation 

--

### We use remote sensing data (MODIS Vegetation Continuous Field) 

--

### To calculate the fluctuations of the largest patch $RS_{max}$ relative to the total forest area

--

### We defined big continental regions (greater than 10 millons Km²)

--
### We used different forest % thresholds to determine patch sizes 

---
class:  center, middle, inverse

## Early warnings of fragmentation 

--
### A combination of spatial and temporal indicators is more reliable 

--
### When the forest its closer to a critical transition

--
### The size $RS_{max}$ tends to get smaller

--
### Increase its variance

--
### The variation $\Delta RS_{max}$ is biased towards lower values

## Regions near a critical transition 

--
### South America tropical and subtropical (SAST1)

--
### Southeast Asia mainland (SEAS1) 

--
### Africa mainland (AF1) met all criteria at least for one threshold

--
### these regions generally experience the biggest rates of deforestation with a significant increase in loss of forest

# Things to do

--
### Check the Power of the method models

--
## Fit forest dynamics with rain/temperature as control variable

--
### Could be applied to other vegetation types

### To smaller regions with higher resolutions sensors
